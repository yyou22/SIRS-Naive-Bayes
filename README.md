# SIRS - Naive Bayes Classifer
Authors: Yuzhe You, Ziyuan Sun

This is an implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithmn using MIMIC-III data on septic patients.
The goal of this project is to evaluate the SIRS scoring system through data extraction/visualization and machine learning.

In this study, we investigate the performance of the Naive Bayes Model using three different approaches:
* Using the columns `temperature`, `heartrate`, `resprate`, `paco2` and `wbc`;
* Using only the patients' SIRS scores
* Using both `temperature`, `hearrate`, `resprate`, `paco2`, `wbc` and the patients' SIRS scores
